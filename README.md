# Improvements

## TODO
[] Migrate the wallpaper management to an external repository,
which should download wallpapers from a given source

[] Change the Spotify CLI interactions to the spotify daemon
having the DBus interacting, instead of spotify directly on the 
keybinds (allows usage of other players)

[] Combine Spotify TUI with SpotifyD to avoid the usage of the
client "as-is"
